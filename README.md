# ECE2112 - PA1
## EXPERIMENT 1
## INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING


I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
   1. To identify the basic codes and functions in Python Programming
   2. To be able to apply the different codes and functions in creating a Python program.


II. Instructions:
Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems.


Problems: 

**ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM**: Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters
in alphabetical order.

Example: alphabet_soup(“hello”) ➞ ehllo
alphabet_soup(“hacker”) ➞ acehkr

**EMOTICON PROBLEM**: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence
as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticon.

Example: emotify(“Make me smile”) ➞ Make me :)
emotify(“I am mad”) ➞ I am >:(


**UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM**: Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three
variables.

Example: lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Output: first: 1        middle: [2,3,4,5]            last: 6


How I did my code:
